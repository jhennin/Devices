Exercise Package 4:
Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJT):
	1. Consider a Silicon NPN BJT:
		a. How many PN junctions in the BJT?
		b. Which layer of material is the thinnest and what type? Sketch the NPN structure to
		illustrate it.
		c. Which layer of a NPN BJT is called Base? Draw the symbol of NPN BJT to illustrate it.
		d. The reverse saturation current between collector and base, ICBO is typically measured
		with emitter open. Considering this BJT is operated at 25oC, calculate the ICBO use the model I = T(3+gamma)e(−Eg) with gamma=1. Explain why can you use this model to estimate ICBO?
		e. The collector current caused by the majority carriers IC=IC_majority=αIE where IE is the
		emitter current and α=0.99. Based on KCL principal, find IB, as IC=4mA.
		f. Considering the current caused by the minority carrier in PN junction of CB which is
		reverse biased in applications, the collector current will have two parts
		IC=IC_majority+ ICBO= αIE+ ICBO. By substituting IE= IC+IB, it yields
		𝐼𝐶= 𝛼 𝐼𝐵+𝐼𝐶𝐵𝑂 1−𝛼 1−𝛼
		where 𝐼𝐶𝐸𝑂 = 𝐼𝐶𝐵𝑂 = (𝛽 + 1)𝐼𝐶𝐵𝑂 is the leakage current flowing to emitter from 1−𝛼
		collector caused by ICBO. Use the estimated ICBO current found in 1d. and α=0.99, to calculate the estimation of leakage current ICEO which is amplified by 𝛽 = 𝛼 (typically
		100~200), from the highly temperature sensitive leakage current ICBO. (Note: ICBO is called “Collector Cutoff Current” in the specification sheet of 2N3904 with notation ICEX which is <50nA.)
		𝑉𝐵𝐸
		g. Considering the BJT is operated at 25 oC, calculate 𝐼𝐵 = 𝐼𝐶𝐵𝑂 (𝑒𝑛𝑉𝑇 − 1) where ICBO is
		the leakage current calculated in part 1d., n=2, and VBE=0.65V. (Note: Due to the symmetry of PN junction in BJT, ICBO and IEBO are equal. In the 1N3904 specification sheet, it is IBL which is called “Base Cutoff Current” and <50nA.)
		h. Following the results from 1d. 1f. and 1g., calculate IC=βIB+ICEO. What is the percentage of leakage current ICEO in the current IC?


	2. Use the collector characteristics of a BJT at 25oC shown below to answer the questions:
		a. What is the power rating of the BJT?
		b. If it de-rates at 5mW per degree over 25oC, what is the power rate of the BJT at 55 oC?
		c. Estimate the βac and βdc at operation point “B”, “C”, and (VCE=6V, IC=20mA) respectively.
		d. Find the maximum limit of IC for VCE=10V at 25oC and 55 oC respectively.
		e. Find the power dissipated by the BJT and operation point “B”, “C”, and “D” respectively.
		f. As VCE<0.5V (estimated from characteristics), the BJT is in the saturation region (also
		known as ohmic region), can you find the estimated resistance value RCE for this BJT?
		    1−𝛼
		g. Tip: print out the collector characteristic and use a ruler to help you get a good estimation.

		11).
		g. Estimate the βac at 25oC and 125oC (Figure 15) (in the same test conditions of f.).

Some answer keys:
1d. Is=118pA
1f. ICEO=12nA
1g. IB=37μA
1h. IC=3.6mA where ICEO is only 0.00032%
2a. It is estimated about 165 to 175mW as 10V*17.5mA or 12.5V*13.5 mA (red lines) etc. 2b. 30oC will cause 150mW in power derate, it is only 15-25mW rating at 55oC
2c. At “B,” βac= (10.5mA-7.5mA)/10μA=300 and βdc=10.5mA/30μA=350 (blue lines)
At (VCE=6V, IC=20mA), βac= (20mA-17mA)/10μA=300 and βdc=20mA/60μA=333 (blue lines)
2d. Due to the power rating, the maximum limit of IC=17.5mA at 25oC and only 2.5mA at 55oC. 2e. At “B,” Pdiss=VCE*IC=8V*10.5mA=84mW. Similarly, at “C” is 2.5V*4mA=10mW and
at “D” is 17V*8mA=136mW (green line)
2f. Assume VCE_Sat=0.3V and the corresponding current on the Collector Characteristics is about 17mA.
The resistor value is 0.3V/17mA=17.6Ω.
3a. Reversed bias of VBE=−3V establishes a thicker depletion region at the base-emitter PN junction which effectively prevents the ICEO (induced by ICBO) diffuse through to the emitter. Therefore, only current measured at the collector is the current ICBO.
3b. listed as ICEX (collector cutoff current, also IBL base cutoff current in the same measurement conditions) <50nA
3c. 550mW
3d. between 100 to 300.
3e. 150; 3g. βac=150 at 25oC and βac=150*1.5=235 at 125oC; 3h. 0.2 or 0.3V to 40V; 3i. upto 200mA.
