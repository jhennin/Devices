% Explain majority carrier and minority carrier in n-type semiconductor
% materials:

% P-type and N-tpe materials have majority and minority carriers

% Majority carriers have more of a certain property, whether it is holes or
% electrons.

% Minority carriers have less of a certain property, whether it is holes or
% electrons.

% P-Type material has ecess holes and very few electrons. It can be said
% that for P-type materials holes are the majority carrier and electrons
% are the minority carrier.

% N-type material has excess electrons and few holes. It can be said for
% N-type materials that they electrons as the majority carrier and holes as
% the minority carrier
